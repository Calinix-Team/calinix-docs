Tiling uses the whole screen estate of your monitor, hence after 2-3 applications in one window you would want to shift to another workspace.

Take the graphical user interface (GUI) you use. With Windows and macOS, you're locked into the desktops Microsoft and Apple, respectively, have chosen for you. But with Linux desktop environments, the sky's the limit. We tested the two main ways to customize Linux \u2014 a windows manager and a desktop environment \u2014 to help you choose. There are many ways to customize a Linux environment. Depending on the Linux distribution you use and how tech-savvy you are, you may want a window manager, a desktop environment, or both. What Is a Window Manager? The window manager is responsible for the placement of the windows, how they are arranged on the screen, how they interact with each other, and, up to a point, their appearance. It\u2019s easier to understand what window managers are if you look at their two different subcategories: stacking and tiling. Tiling window managers display the full contents of all active windows next to each other. They split the screen into many smaller parts and place each application in them. Some popular tiling window managers are i3, awesome, bspwm, and Ratpoison. Stacking window managers are the paradigm most people are familiar with and allow windows to float and cover each other. They allow you to move a window around the screen freely, change its size, place two of them next to or over each other, etc. However, the distinction between them isn\u2019t always straightforward. Some tiling window managers may also allow some windows to float freely, move around, and resize. Similarly, modern stacking window managers may also offer functions that help tile windows next to each other. What Is a Desktop Environment? Building on the window manager, the desktop environment adds the final graphic touches to the visual desktop experience. At its base, the desktop environment is responsible for the toolbars, panels, and all the little tools we take for granted when using our desktop. Among them is the clipboard manager, the applets that allow us to control our network connections or move between virtual desktops, etc. Some of the most popular full-blown desktop environments in Linux are Gnome, KDE, and XFCE. A desktop environment also (usually) comes with a suite of apps. A text editor, calendars, process viewers, and, of course, a file manager are among the essential tools that come with most desktop environments. When you realize that a window manager doesn\u2019t come with all of this, the distinction between them and a desktop environment becomes more apparent. Window Managers Pros Way Less memory/CPU usage than most desktop environments Highly configurable Has almost no bundled software with it, totally vanilla with as much less bloat as possible Cons Not as user-friendly if you want to make heavy customizations. Some learning curve Desktop Environments Pros More newbie-friendly Easier to customize Cons Requires more resources Certain desktop environments can feel slow and bloated \u2013 especially on underpowered and older hardware Miss tiling features unless force implemented.

It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code. Put simply virtual machines---known as VMs---are applications that create a software environment that mimics computer hardware. An operating system can then be installed into this environment. We call this a \"guest OS\", while the operating system you have installed on your physical computer is the \"host OS\". Additionally, virtualization can be enhanced with the help of dedicated system hardware! Virtual Machines vs. Dual Booting Linux There are two ways to run multiple operating systems on a computer: Dual booting Virtual machine Dual booting is good but has its downsides. For example, you can run two or more Linux distributions installed on your computer. However, it doesn't work well for everyone. Various issues can frustrate the experience, such as rebooting. The time taken to restart, select a different OS at the GRUB bootloader screen, and then boot, can be problematic. This is especially true on systems where Linux is installed alongside Windows. On slower systems, you could be waiting 5-10 minutes before you can start being productive. With anti-virus software scanning at boot, you're soon on a massive go-slow. However, running your secondary OS in a virtual machine can overcome this problem. Check if your PC supports Virtualization To check if your PC supports virtualization, fire up the terminal and enter lscpu | grep \"Virtualization\" You should see something like AMD-V, VT-x or VT-d to confirm your PC supports virtualization. Let's see the different ways of Virtualization QEMU/KVM KVM is one of the most used Virtualization software in Linux World. In fact, most cloud providers use KVM as their Hypervisor of choice.

When you visit the download page you will find a link to each of the four main editions , as well as a checksum file for each. A checksum can be used to check the integrity of the disc image file you download to make sure it hasn\u2019t been corrupted during the download. Latest Stable ISO Navigate to the Download Page of all editions of Calinix. Download the latest stable ISO from the website. Latest Development ISO We use Github Actions and Artifacts to automate our disc image (ISO) building process. Hence all our latest development ISOs are in our Actions Page . Choose the latest action and in the main page of the specific action, you will find a section called Artifacts which stores our ISOs. Simply click the Artifact named Calinix <Release Tag> DevISO and a .zip archive will start downloading. Extract the archive. The ISO will be present inside the folder Torrents Our stable releases are hosted as torrents by FossTorrents . It can be directly downloaded. If you use torrents, you know how to. Download CalinixOS Torrents CalinixOS Alpha 6-4 Writing a Disc Image A disc image is not a copy-and-paste duplication of files: it\u2019s a bit-for-bit copy of the raw data that makes up the files and folders of that disc. This is why just copying a disc image file to a disc (or USB flash drive) to begin installing won\u2019t work: you\u2019ll need to use a disc burning or image writing application to translate that raw data into the files and folders. Once converted, the files can be used to run CalinixOS in LiveCD mode without having to install it to your system, and/or install CalinixOS on your system. It\u2019s important to note CalinixOS will not have full functionality when run in Live-CD mode. For example, you will not be able to save any changes to the system. Due to the amount of software included on the full edition disc images you may need to use a DVD instead of a CD. Many people routinely use a DVD rather than a CD even for the smallest disc image files. Not only is a DVD faster to burn but they allow higher data access rates so the Live-CD loads faster and the installation completes sooner. Burning to a CD/DVD in Linux If not already installed, several different software burning applications should be available for installation from your distribution\u2019s Software Center / Software Manager / Package Manager / repositories. Popular burners include XFBurn, K3b, and Brasero. Which one you choose is entirely down to personal choice, though your operating system will usually install one suitable for your desktop environment. To simplify things a little, the following steps for burning your downloaded CalinixOS disc image use Brasero . Burning using Brasero - Insert a blank CD/DVD. - Start the Brasero software burner. - Click the Burn Image - Burn an existing CD/DVD image to disc button to open the Image Burning Setup window. - Click the button beneath the title Select a disc image to write to open up your file manager. Locate and double-click the downloaded disc image file to load it. Upon automatically returning to the Image Burning Setup window, note that the disc image file is now listed as the disc image to write. - The blank CD/DVD you inserted should be automatically listed underneath the title Select a disc to write to. If not, click the button to select it manually. - Click the properties button to open the properties window, and then click the button beneath the title Burning Speed . We strongly recommend you select the slowest speed available. Once selected, click the Close button. We strongly recommend you select the slowest speed available when burning to disc in order minimise the possibility of corruption during the burning process. - Click the Burn button to start the burning process. If necessary, follow any on-screen instructions provided. Burning using Windows Disc Image Burner Right-clicking on the disc image file and selecting Burn disc image will start the Windows Disc Image Burner program. This makes the process of burning to a disc very straightforward: Insert a blank CD/DVD into your disc drive. Start Windows Disc Image Burner . Select your CD/DVD drive in the Disc burner menu. Click Burn . Writing to a USB flash drive in Linux To take advantage of the faster access times and much quieter nature of a USB flash drive, there are a number of methods of writing the disc image file. One of the easiest is to use SUSE Studio Imagewriter . SUSE Studio Imagewriter should be available for installation from your distribution\u2019s Software Center / Software Manager / Package Manager / repositories. Once SUSE Studio Imagewriter has been downloaded and installed, ensure that your USB flash drive is plugged in before starting the application. The process of using SUSE Studio Imagewriter is very straightforward: Click on the centre icon. Navigate to where you downloaded the disc image file, and select it. Ensure that your USB flash drive has been selected from the dropdown menu. Click on the Write button. Once it has finished, reboot your system, making sure to select the USB flash drive as the boot device in the BIOS menu (or its UEFI equivalent). Using the CLI If you don\u2019t want to install extra software, and you are comfortable using the command line, there\u2019s an even easier way of writing a disc image to a USB device. Connect the USB flash drive to your PC, open a terminal and cd to where you downloaded the disc image. Check the device identifier with: sudo fdisk -l . Write the image with: sudo dd if=path/to/{ISO File} of=/dev/(Device identifier from above) bs=4M My USB drive is at /dev/sdb and ISO is at ~/Downloads/Calinix-Arch-21.11.21-x86_64.iso So I would use: sudo dd if=~/Downloads/Calinix-Arch-21.11.21-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M Once completed reboot your system and boot from the USB drive by selecting it as the boot device in the BIOS menu (or its UEFI equivalent). Writing to a USB flash drive in Microsoft Windows Rufus For Windows users using USB media, Rufus is highly recommended. Select the USB key to be used in the Device menu. Then, on the line beginning with Boot selection, click on Select to select your downloaded disc image, and then Start. After doing so, select DD Image in the window that appears. Rufus with recommended settings Etcher Another recommended piece of software is Etcher. It is incredibly simple to use. All you have to do is select the disc image, the USB drive, and start flashing the image!","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"starters-guide/getting-started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"starters-guide/getting-started/#downloading-calinixos","text":"Every release of CalinixOS is available for download, whether the current stable release or upcoming preview releases.

This is why just copying a disc image file to a disc (or USB flash drive) to begin installing won\u2019t work: you\u2019ll need to use a disc burning or image writing application to translate that raw data into the files and folders. Once converted, the files can be used to run CalinixOS in LiveCD mode without having to install it to your system, and/or install CalinixOS on your system. It\u2019s important to note CalinixOS will not have full functionality when run in Live-CD mode. For example, you will not be able to save any changes to the system. Due to the amount of software included on the full edition disc images you may need to use a DVD instead of a CD. Many people routinely use a DVD rather than a CD even for the smallest disc image files. Not only is a DVD faster to burn but they allow higher data access rates so the Live-CD loads faster and the installation completes sooner.","title":"Writing a Disc Image"},{"location":"starters-guide/getting-started/#burning-to-a-cddvd-in-linux","text":"If not already installed, several different software burning applications should be available for installation from your distribution\u2019s Software Center / Software Manager / Package Manager / repositories. Popular burners include XFBurn, K3b, and Brasero.

To simplify things a little, the following steps for burning your downloaded CalinixOS disc image use Brasero . Burning using Brasero - Insert a blank CD/DVD. - Start the Brasero software burner. - Click the Burn Image - Burn an existing CD/DVD image to disc button to open the Image Burning Setup window. - Click the button beneath the title Select a disc image to write to open up your file manager.

It does not include the old EFI v1, or Apple\u2019s own non-standard version of EFI. Some newer hardware do not use the well-known BIOS to manage boot options. Instead, a new one named UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is used. It still has BIOS-like menus and often has a legacy mode, which uses BIOS. UEFI often goes hand in hand with the infamous Secure Boot option that makes it more difficult to boot operating systems outside of a select few. If your computer came with Microsoft Windows 8 or later installed, your computer probably uses UEFI and has Secure Boot enabled by default. However, the Linux community reacted to this and developed means to install and boot Linux on those systems as well. Some installers, such as Calamares which is used by CalinixOS, can even automate the process so it makes virtually no difference to the user whether their machine uses UEFI or BIOS. Booting in UEFI mode The most important step is to ensure that your machine does not have Fast Boot enabled . Only a very limited number of operating systems will boot with this enabled. You must disable Fast Boot in your UEFI/BIOS before proceeding; if you don\u2019t know how to do this please refer to your computer\u2019s user manual, as it differs for all computers.","title":"Installation Guide"},{"location":"starters-guide/installation/#installation-guide","text":"","title":"Installation Guide"},{"location":"starters-guide/installation/#booting-the-live-environment","text":"Booting the Live environment, whether from CD/DVD or USB flash drive, will give you an overview of the CalinixOS environment and let you test how well it will run on your machine.
